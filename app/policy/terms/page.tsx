        Subscription Fees and Payment

        The App is free to download and the Website is free to access. However,
        certain features of the Service are offered for a fee on a subscription
        basis or one-time payment basis. You may make a purchase directly from
        the Company (through the Website) or through an App Store (the
        “Purchase”). You authorize us, the App Stores and the payment providers
        we cooperate with to charge the applicable fees to the payment card that
        you submit.
      </p>
      <p className="py-2 text-zinc-600">
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change the
        Purchase fee at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such
        pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the Service
        and/or by sending you an email notification. If you do not wish to pay
        the new fees, you can cancel the applicable subscription prior to the

        subscription you authorize us, the App Stores, and the payment providers
        we cooperate with to charge you for the renewal term. The period of
        auto-renewal will be the same as your initial subscription period unless
        otherwise disclosed to you on the Service. The renewal rate will be no
        more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period,
        excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless we notify you of
        a rate change prior to your auto-renewal. You must cancel your
        subscription in accordance with the cancellation procedures disclosed to
        you for the particular subscription. We will not refund fees that may
        have accrued to your account and will not prorate fees for a cancelled
        subscription.

      <p className="py-2 text-zinc-600">
        We may offer a trial subscription for the Service. Trial provides you
        access to the Service for a period of time, with details specified when
        you sign up for the offer. Unless you cancel before the end of the
        trial, or unless otherwise stated, your access to the Service will
        automatically continue and you will be billed the applicable fees for
        the Service. It is ultimately your responsibility to know when the trial
        will end. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to modify or
        terminate any trial offer, your access to the Service during the trial,
        or any of these terms without notice and with no liability. We reserve

        The Service and your rights to use it expire at the end of the paid
        period of your subscription or when you have used all other services
        included in the package you purchased. If you do not pay the fees or
        charges due, we may make reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve
        the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate your
        access to the Service (and may do so without notice).
